# Mandelbrot Zoom (200050141)

This is currently incomplete. 

For the timebeing, this only draws the Mandelbrot Set, in greyscale using the SFML libraries. The zoom would be implemented subsequetly.

## Compilation and Build
```bash
$ sudo apt install libsfml-dev
# replace apt with a suitable package manager
```
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/swayamchube/cs293-project
```
```bash
$ cd cs293-project
$ mkdir build
$ make # This places the executable in ./build/project
```

**NOTE:** If you are using a tiling window manager like DWM, you may want to switch to floating mode, unless you want an ill-formed window.
